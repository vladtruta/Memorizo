# Memorizo
Memorizo is a game I created by challenging myself to build it in one single day.

It is a reboot of the classic Memory Blocks game.

The rules are simple: find the matching pictures and finish the board in the shortest time possible. There are 3 levels of difficulty, each of them increasing the number of picture pairs on the board.
